# Data oriented programming pillars:

  -  Separate code from data
  -  Represent data with generic data structures
  -  Data should be immutable
  -  Use pure functions to manipulate data
  -  Keep data flat and denormalized
  -  Keep data generic until it needs to be specific
  -  Data integrity is maintained through validation functions
  -  Data access should be flexible and generic
  -  Data transformation should be explicit and traceable
  -  Data flow should be unidirectional
